# Introduction of JavaScript
JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
More on JavaScript can be found on it's Wiki [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).  **Inventor** pictured *below*!
